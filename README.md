# SszSharp

A C# implemention of SimpleSerialize. Very much a WIP.

- Serialization and deserialization is supported. Specify custom container types using the SszElement attribute.
- Merkleization is supported. Merkle proofs can be created and verified using the Merkleizer class.
- Union types are untested.
